Download the files `git clone https://github.com/bernatixer/TeamHack.git`

Now, enter the directory: `cd TeamHack`

We have to download the dependencies, `npm install`

We need a firebase API [key](https://firebase.google.com/), once you have one, you can put it on te file 'public/app.js' at line 58, you also need to modify lines 59 and 60.

Well done, je just need to open the server, just run:
